This is the start of a project I am working on. I have a high-resolution camera, outputting 2560x1440, and I am testing the performance of the standard Hailo streaming detection approach, where the high-resolution stream is resized to match the model input of 640x640, against a motion detection algorithm that crops the high-resolution frame for sections where motion is detected to the model input size.
Additionally, since I don’t copy and paste code from Github or SO without understanding it, I wanted to document the process of creating and calling the Hailo8 inferencing engine. Hopefully, if anyone reads this, they'll find it helpful. Comments are welcome.
